## Bering Sea Flatfish

**This project investigates the NOAA RACE Eastern Bering Sea Shelf Survey Data through data visualization, focusing on: Alaska plaice, yellowfin sole, northern rock sole, and flathead sole. Find the report [here](https://github.com/erickabsmith/flatfish_2020/blob/master/results/Summary_Report.pdf).**

To Use:
Access the data yourself on the google drive link. Having the `intermediates` folder is all that's needed to create the plots, but if you want to change any data cleaning steps you'll have to access the original csv files and make changes in `data_initial.R`.

To recreate any multipanel figures that already exist you'll want the `run` files.



Things to note:

* Any code producing results can be found in the `analysis` folder. 
* The `work_sessions` folder is (almost) exclusively for EDA documentation and notes.
* Data must be accessed independently.
