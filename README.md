## Bering Sea Flatfish

**This project investigates the NOAA RACE Eastern Bering Sea Shelf Survey Data through data visualization, focusing on: Alaska plaice, yellowfin sole, northern rock sole, and flathead sole. Find the report [here](https://github.com/erickabsmith/flatfish_2020/blob/master/results/Summary_Report.pdf).**



Things to note:

* All code producing results can be found in the `analysis` folder. 
* The `work_sessions` folder is almost exclusively for work documentation and notes.
* Data must be accessed independently. 
* `_wc` is used in file names to distinguish plots that compare warm and cold years from `_mhw` which denotes plots comparing extreme marine heat wave years.
