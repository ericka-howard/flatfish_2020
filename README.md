## Bering Sea Flatfish

**This repository includes supporting code for:**  
*Ciannelli L, Smith E, Kearney K, Hunsicker M, McGilliard C (2022) Greater exposure of nearshore habitats in the Bering Sea makes fish early life stages vulnerable to climate change. Mar Ecol Prog Ser 684:91-102. https://doi.org/10.3354/meps13977*


Things to note:

* Any code producing results can be found in the `analysis` folder. 
* The `work_sessions` folder is (almost) exclusively for EDA documentation and notes.
* Data must be accessed independently. 


To Use:

* Having the `intermediates` folder is all that's needed to create the plots, but if you want to change any data cleaning steps you'll have to access the original csv files and make changes in `data_initial.R`.
* To recreate any multipanel figures that already exist you'll want the `run` files.
